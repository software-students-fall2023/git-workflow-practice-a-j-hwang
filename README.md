This article discusses the AI's evolving role in society, the challenges it poses, and some consequences it may have for human interaction and communication. 

Tha article indicates that the main chellange faced by AI chatbots is **the complexity of human language** such as emotional and cultural nuances. It suggests that while chatbots like ChatGPT may replicate human conversation, they are often unable to capture the depth of human interaction. The article concludes by discussing the good old dream in the tech industry of developing an AI that can form meaningful relationships with humans. It ends by raising a question about whether AI can truly replicate human emotions and connections.

It surprised me to acknowledge that AI chatbots and related technologies has been so massively progressed, that we are by far done with the usual discussion of 'how useful it is' or 'where to use them' and now considering 'how similar it should / can be to humans'. 

On the other note, it was interesting learn about AI usage in game development, particularly in the creation of non-player characters (NPCs). It will be great to have a interpersonal, human-like connection with game characters, but I'd say there's definitely some ethical dilemmas related in this matter.
